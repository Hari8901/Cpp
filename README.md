# "FinSecure Banking System” – A C++ Console App

FinSecure Bank needs a terminal-based system to:

1. Create accounts (Savings / Current)
2. Allow deposit and withdrawal
3. Handle errors (e.g., overdraft, invalid input)
4. Uses STL containers for customer/account management
5. Display type of account using RTTI
